Use your body weight to compress the chest at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep for adults. For children, compress about 2 inches (5 cm), and for infants, compress about 1.5 inches (4 cm).
                    <br>Compression Rate: Perform compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. Allow the chest to fully recoil between compressions.

    <h2>FAQ's</h2>
</div>
<div  style= " border:2px solid blue;border-radius:10px;padding:10px;">
   <h3>Q.  When should I perform CPR?</h3>
   <h5>CPR should be performed when a person is unresponsive and not breathing or not breathing normally (e.g., only gasping). This situation indicates that their heart may have stopped, and immediate action is necessary.</h5>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Q.   What if I'm not trained in CPR?</h3>
   <h5>If you're not trained, perform hands-only CPR, which means doing chest compressions without rescue breaths. Push hard and fast in the center of the chest until emergency help arrives.</h5>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Q.   Can I break someone's ribs during CPR?</h3>
   <h5>It's possible to break ribs during CPR, especially in older adults. However, the risk of not performing CPR is much greater than the risk of broken ribs.</h5>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Q.  Is CPR effective?</h3>
   <h5>CPR can significantly increase the chances of survival for a person in cardiac arrest, especially if performed immediately. However, outcomes can vary depending on how quickly it is administered and the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest.</h5>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Q.   What if I get tired during CPR?</h3>
   <h5>If possible, alternate with another person every two minutes to avoid fatigue. If you're alone, do your best to keep going until help arrives.</h5>
